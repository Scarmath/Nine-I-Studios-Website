<h2>Steal These Ideas</h2>
<h3>by Caroline Clune</h3>

<p>Stealing ideas is going to be a running theme of this site. It is here to inspire, to exist as a catalyst for creative acts, to encourage freedom of thought and speech. In these sandbox pages, we are going to exploring how to come up with ideas, gaining perspective on what challenges and blocks the process of following ideas through their processes of inception, what silences and censors from within before the rest of the world even has a chance. This is here because we cannot be left alone, because we need other voices, thoughts, sensations, visions, even if we think we operate solo. How can we gain these elusive ideas flowering into fruition without a bit of daring and edginess like the feeling that we are getting away with something, something so big it can't have come from us?</p>

<p>This is for all the stupid questions, all the daydream thoughts, that appear to have no value, no contribution except to be frivolous or irritating, distractions and wastes of time. How would you get a train to run on a ceiling? What secrets do fire hoses keep? How much can happen in five minutes? If there are no stupid questions, then why do we keep telling ourselves there are, and why do others keep telling us about the exceptions? This is a place for us to explore our way around the tricky ideas of failure, of fear, of hesitation, of losing, of risk.</p>

<p>On a personal level this site exists to push me out of thinking and into action. Writing is action, creating art is action, doing something to make stupid questions get answered, or at least explored in some way is an action. Doing Anything. Pick a verb. Pick any action you can think of. I can think of many, but I act on few. I have so much potential burning me up, but when I try to work alone, things rarely happen, are rarely finished much as less started. This page is a selfish desire on my part, to put all my power into thinking and inventing more concepts than I can ever act on, but to force me to act on some. I needed a place where ideas were OK to have in abundance, where acting on some of them was the course, but where all that I could were allowed to be explored, so long as I explored them. I want to prove myself wrong, that I can act, as well as think. I don't want to be alone, and I don't have to be alone. I want to present evidence that progress is being made. That progress can be made. If I can do it, anyone can. You can. I want to document the process, and now is the time, right in the middle of when I am at my most stuck and most inspired.</p>

<p>Why a website? For the element of public and social participation. To experience the brutal honesty of how hard it is to create, and share it with others. Now is the time for action, and creation, and meeting fear, and one of the best ways is to be transparent about how to put ideas and thoughts out of a passive state. To force the action, not just the thought, and feel consequence out of connection with others. To progress the ideas and help break the fears involves theft at times. Everything we do and think is made up of associations. The purpose of encouraging idea thievery is to explode the notion that all ideas have been done before. They have not been done by Us. This is the catalyst.</p>
